                                    levels. Finally, you’ll be learning about some design philosophy regarding aerial

                                    covers the built in Unity tools for audio mixing and effects. The lab covers an
                                    audio manager script for managing various audio sources, and the lab will also
                                    cover audio mixers. Audio mixers allow for different effects and sounds to have
                                    different output volumes and various adjustments such as lowpass, reverb, and more.
                                    This lab does not cover spatial audio, audio editing, or music composition.

                                    player health are affected using code and the inspector in this lab. Coding will

                                    more information on the code itself. Prefabs, a base for various kinds of
                                    GameObjects, are covered in this lab from their creation as well as their use.
                                    Enemies will be derived from a base prefab called Enemy, and students will create a
                                    new enemy based off of the Prefab.

                                    with all the functions you need to know to use colliders effectively, and have used

                                    improve the performance of your game, so they’re definitely worth learning! Through

                                    movement and develop a solid understanding of coroutines that will allow you to

                                    Most basic introduction to all things Unity. This lab goes over the format, object
                                    structure and most general information of Unity. This does not require any
                                    knowledge of Unity, coding or art. By the end of the lab, you’ll have made a simple
                                    space game moving around to get collectibles.

                                    In this lab, you’ll create smooth transitions between 2D animations using Blend
                                    Trees. Blend trees are a must for organizing complicated animation transitions in
                                    Animator. They’re used to quickly handle transitions between animations when the
                                    player provides new input. In 3D games, they actually interpolate between the two
                                    animations, creating a smooth transition. We will only be going over the 2D
                                    version, but all the concepts apply to 3D animations.

                                    forward, you will have the ability to use those modules to create your own unique

                                    your own game ready sprites and assets. It also covers the basic workflow as well
                                    as useful resources in learning even more. This lab is in Photoshop; however you
                                    can use any other pixel sprinting software. Unity is not required for this lab.

                                    of animation principles, we will be introducing two methods of creating animations:
                                    a sprite-based method, and a puppet-based method that uses many of the tools that
                                    3D animations use.

                                    In this lab, you’ll learn how to use Tilemaps to create a level. It will go over
                                    the process of cutting a spritesheet and assigning sprites to specific tiles. The
                                    Unity implemented Tilemap is able to easily create new levels with specific tiles
                                    that contain rules, animations, randomizationndom generation, and tile setting
                                    conditions. It is an easy way to make many levels and, once set up, easy for
                                    everyone of all programming levels to do. With more programming, more unique
                                    brushes, rulesets and randomization can be created to generate dynamic levels
                                    without the hassle of gameobjects and prefabs.

                                    to implementing masks. This first half of this lab goes over the Unity components
                                    you need and the second half is split, where programmers learn the scripting
                                    required for events and artists learn about the design behind UI.

                                    means to merge the bones and joints with the actual model so that the model can be
                                    manipulated, and animating is the actual animation of the model using the joints
                                    and bones.
