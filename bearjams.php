                    Join Game Design and Development at Berkeley for Bear Jams! Bear Jams is a 45-hr game jam open to everyone, not just UC Berkeley students! 
                    <br><br>
                    The event starts at 6:00PM where we give an introduction, followed by the theme reveal @ 6:30 PM. There will be time to get to know other participants and form teams in the Zoom call afterward.
                    <br><br>
                    After the theme is announced, our Discord will have voice and chat channels open for participants to hang-out, make teams, and contact staff. Participants are welcome to @ any of the staff at any time and are more than welcome to ask both questions about the event and for help with their game.
                    <br><br>
                    This jam is hosted on the GDD itch.io at <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bear-jams-spring-2021">itch.io/jam/bear-jams-fall-2020</a>. <strong>Make sure you join and submit there!</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Submissions will be due at 3 PM PST on Sunday (we will have a 10 minute grace period BUT DON'T ABUSE IT). Winners will be announced during the showcase from 7 - 8:30 PM PST on Sunday.  
                    <br><br>
                    Participation is open to everyone, not just Berkeley students! There is no difference between teams with and without students! We are excited to see all of the wonderful games you guys will create!
                    <br><br>
